The Average Calculator project you implemented allows users to calculate the average grade of their modules based on the grade, credit points, and the semester in which each module was completed. 
The goal of the project is to provide an easy-to-use tool to track performance across different modules and present the results visually.

Project Description:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

HTML provides the structure for the project. It includes form fields where the user can input the grades, credit points, and the semester for each module.
There are also areas to display the calculated average grade and the statistical graph.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

CSS is used to style the project and make it visually appealing. It ensures that the input fields, buttons, and the chart are well-organized and user-friendly.
Additionally, CSS ensures the design is responsive, so the interface works well on different devices.

JavaScript (JS):

JavaScript handles the calculation and interactivity of the project. It calculates the average grade based on the input values for credit points and grades. 
JavaScript also processes the input data and updates the statistical graph, which visually represents the distribution of grades and the average. 
It is also used to validate the input forms and dynamically display the semester grades and their average.

Project Features:


Grade and Credit Point Input:
The user enters the grades and corresponding credit points for each module, as well as the semester in which the module was completed.

Average Calculation:
 
Based on the entered grades and credit points, the weighted average is automatically calculated.

Statistical Visualization:

After the calculation, a graphical representation of the grades and their distribution across different semesters is created. 
This could be displayed as a bar chart or line graph showing the grades of the modules over time.

Semester Display:

For each module, the semester in which the grade was achieved is also shown, helping the user track progress over time.

Benefits:

The user can quickly see how their grades have developed over the semesters.
The weighted average calculation ensures that the importance of each module is accurately reflected based on credit points.
The visual representation of the data in a graph makes it easier to spot patterns and trends.
This project is particularly useful for students who want to track their academic performance and provides an interactive way to visualize their progress.
